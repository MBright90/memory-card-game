# Star Wars: Mind Training
Welcome to the Star Wars Memory Game! In this game, you will be presented with twelve cards featuring Star Wars characters. Your goal is to click all the cards without clicking any of them twice. The cards will move after each click, so you have to remember which ones you've already clicked. The page will keep track of your current score and your best score of the session.

### Getting Started
To get started, simply open the index.html file in your web browser of choice. The game should start automatically.

### How to Play
To play the game, simply click on any card you have not clicked on before. If you are successful, the cards will shuffle and you will need to try and remember all the characters you have already clicked. If you are unsuccessful your score will return to zero and flash red to indicate an incorrect choice.

You win the game by successfully clicking on all twelve cards without clicking any of them twice. Your score will be based on the number of clicks you achieve before duplicating a choice.

The cards will move after each click, so you will have to remember which ones you've already clicked. The page will keep track of your current score and your best score of the session.
